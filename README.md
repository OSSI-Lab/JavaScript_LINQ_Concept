# JavaScript LINQ Concept 1.0

![JavaScript LINQ Concept](/JLC_1_0_logo.png)

This library is aimed to work in FCU or in the FrontEnd apps in general and will serve the same purpose as LINQ in C#. \
The parameters of methods of the same names like C#'s LINQ are exactly the same or as close as possible. \
\
My goal was to:
 - provide the exact functionality from LINQ in C# and transfer it stright into plain JavaScript from the user point of view
 - chose the methods that I considered the JavaScript-logical ones

JavaScript LINQ is the real thing since 22-June-2020 !

If you do not understand the architecture, do not understand what JavaScript LINQ stands for, or you are struggle to get to grips with figuring out engineering of the internal implementation, please request official explanation by making official inquary to me.

I highly encourage reading this amazing article treating about [C# LINQ in detail](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/383749/How-does-it-work-in-Csharp-Part-3-Csharp-LINQ-in-d "How does it work in C# ?") to better understand inner workings of LINQ ! \
By the way, taking advantage of the occasion there are 3 books that every C#-oriented developer should have on his/her shelf... \
(guess, whether I have them or not ? :smirk:)

      - bugs found while testing up to a point called [ // CODE WAS TESTED UNTIL HERE ! ]
      - due to design approach, JavaScript nature and for optimization purposes JLC's query methods called 'reverse' and 'reverseExt' had to be renamed to 'reverseAllOrSubset'. One method that serves the same purpose as the previous two ones.
      - I chose 'reverseAllOrSubset' to be final method in JavaScript that returns new collection in contrast to what it does in C#, because IMHO it better fits the purpose of JavaScript nature !

        - subsequent invocation of such already-invoked-method in the flow chain is retrieved directly from the API object

    - features:
      - enabling creating partial queries with preserved dependency relationship between 1st & 2nd level sorting methods by introducing action constraints !
      - enabling defining new methods in a declarative way !
        - JavaScript LINQ API is being built dynamically from methods' metadata (you declare method behaviour - that why it's called 'declarative way', AFAIK !)
      - decoupling layers from each other, i.e. API Layer (AL), Logical Operations Layer (LOL) & Physical Operations Layer (POL) !
  	    - moving syntax checking to LOL (all checks are being done over metadata, not physical data !)
	    - physical data operations are happening only in POL (final methods - the ones that produce output are the only methods that touch physical data !)
